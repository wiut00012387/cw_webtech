I have created an animal veterinary clinic page for a hospital called "Banfield Pet Hospital". This website is mainly for pet enthusiasts and covers many services according to users' needs. This website consists of six pages and one nested page inside the services page. According to hosting purposes, this website was hosted free hosting platform, and the link for this is https://00012387.netlify.app/.

Firstly, when the link for the website is clicked, the user encounters the Main page. The main page includes a little bit of information related to other pages. On the "About" page, you can see the picture of the clinic building with overall information about it. When the user moved from the about section to the services section, he/she can receive more information about the services provided by the hospital by easily clicking the "For more information" button. Moreover, several articles and suggestions were provided on the blog section which is related to animals care and their health.
